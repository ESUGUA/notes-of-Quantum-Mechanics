# NOTES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

I have a long vacation (about 30 days), to urge myself to study and improve my English, I'd like to upload a note of Q.M everyday or two .

The textbook I choose is _Introduction to Quantum Mechanics_ by _David J . Griffiths_.

 13th Jan

â€‹	I've learned part of the _Wave function_. 

 14th Jan

 I can't choose the Q.M the next semester ,so I decide to stop uploading these notes. Insteadly, I will upload the notes of electrodynamics.
